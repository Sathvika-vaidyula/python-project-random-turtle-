Dot Grid Drawing Game
This is a Python program using the turtle module to draw a colorful grid of randomly colored dots. The program generates a 10x10 grid of dots, each with a randomly selected color from a pre-defined color palette.

How It Works:
The program sets up a turtle graphics window.

A turtle moves to the starting position and draws a grid of dots.

Each dot is randomly colored from a list of RGB values.

The turtle continues drawing dots in a grid format (10 rows and 10 columns).
